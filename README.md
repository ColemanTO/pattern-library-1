## Getting started

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/wiki)

## Adding new components/composites

All additions must be approved by our UX team so before working on anything, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/issues) including a detailed description on the requested pattern and several use cases for it.

## Development

- `npm install`
- `npm run build` or for development - `npm run dev` which will rebuild when files are changed

__NOTE__: if a new component or composite is added, remember to create a quick [wiki](https://github.com/dequelabs/pattern-library/wiki) entry explaining what is absolutely necessary in using this widget.

### Testing
Testing is done using mochify along with the 'chai' assertion library (`assert.isFalse(!!0)`).  The `test/` directory structure matches the `lib/` directory.  This means that if you're testing `lib/components/foo/index.js`, you would create a test in `test/components/foo/index.js`.  See the `test/` directory for examples.  The tests are browserified and transpiled before running in the phantomjs headless browser so you can `require` / `import` stuff and use ES6 syntax in the tests.

```bash
$ npm test
```

or to have a watcher re-run tests every time you add a new test:

```bash
$ npm run test:dev
```

### Debugging
The pattern library uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module. To turn all debugging on, execute: `localStorage.debug = 'dqpl:*'` and refresh the page.  The directory structure of lib is used as the debug naming convention. For example, to specifically debug the "selects" component, execute: `localStorage.debug = 'dqpl:components:selects'`.
